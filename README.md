# Interactive visualization
Interactive visualization of research groups on a world map is an innovative tool that allows researchers and scientific communities to visualize the geographic distribution of research groups and their projects worldwide. 
Using this technology, users can interact with the map, explore the location and activities of research teams, and access information about specific projects and their outcomes.
The visualization can also reveal trends and patterns in research activities, identify areas where the most active research groups are concentrated, and pinpoint areas that require further investigation. 
This can help optimize resource allocation and enhance collaboration in the research field.
